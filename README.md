# stat-tracker

# NBA Stat Tracker GUI allows to explorer current and historal player statistics.

This is the first major release of the NBA Stat Tracker. This application is intended for users to compare historical and/or live data on # players. It supports a game log of the most five recent games, live game information, and a global player search.

Thanks to @swar from the public nba_api repo, the information that gets updated are from those endpoints. All issues can be reported and # will be address.

Note, this is still a heavily under-development application. There are many things are still in the works but for now, this will do.
